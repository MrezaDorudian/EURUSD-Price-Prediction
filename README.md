# About The Project
This was my project as an intern in [Roshan-AI](https://www.roshan-ai.ir/) and my first project to train models, it's about classifying the EUR/USD currency in one minute timeframe into 5 classes using linear regression, logistic regression and, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

# Results
Logistic regression seems not working well and randomly classifying the data with 55% accuracy.
RNN is doing much better about 70% accuracy and could be increased with hyper-parameter tuning.

# Built With
It's built with pure python and tensorflow and keras.

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute :)
